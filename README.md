#Fuel Depot

## Description

Fuel Depot was designed to become the new documentation repository of the FuelPHP project. This repository contains the source code of the Depot application, written in FuelPHP offcourse.
It has become obsolete due to the decision to use PHPDocumentor for API documentation, and, for version 2, switch to markdown based documentation with a simple front controller that can be used locally, either with a local webserver or using PHP 5.4's built-in webserver.

## FuelPHP

FuelPHP is a fast, lightweight PHP 5.3 framework. In an age where frameworks are a dime a dozen, We believe that FuelPHP will stand out in the crowd.  It will do this by combining all the things you love about the great frameworks out there, while getting rid of the bad.
